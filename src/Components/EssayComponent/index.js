        <h1> Divine Command Theory: Euthyphro’s insight </h1>
        <p>This essay will define and defend Divine Command Theory as a meta-ethical theory. We will begin by discussing what DCT  is, as well as the challenges it faces and how those challenges can be sublimated into the theory itself.</p> 
        
        <p>
            DCT begins on the premise that moral claims are predicated on a moral law that is given by God. One of the advantages of DCT is that it gives us a rational ground for claiming an objective moral framework . There is a cross cultural, supreme moral law giver who gives us a cross cultural moral law that supersedes any culture. Compared to its subjective counterparts such as cultural relativism, expressionism, and emotivism, this is a strong advantage. It is easy for DCT to explain why the Nazi’s were wrong and why the prison guards at Auschwitz were morally deplorable.
        
        </p>
        <p>
            Nevertheless, DCT has a major problem facing it – the Euthyphro problem. The problem is outlined as such.
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            1.	There is a God.
            2.	There is a moral law given by God.
            3.	The morality of an action depends on its relationship to this moral law. An action is “good” if it abides to the moral law. An action is “bad” if it does not. 
            4.	God is distinct from the moral law.
            5.	When God and the moral law conflict, which should we follow?
        </ol>
        <p>
            The Euthyphro problem emerges when God commands something that conflicts with the moral law. What if God commands you to kill someone for an entirely arbitrary reason? Is the moral thing to do to follow the moral law, or to follow the command given by God?
            There are a few ways to tackle this problem. The first and most obvious way is to say that God would never command such a thing. God is moral being. One of his attributes that make him worthy of our worship is that he is perfectly perfect. As such, a moral being would never command a person to kill someone for an arbitrary reason. In this way we can reconcile God’s omnipotence with the moral law. It is not that God is constrained by the moral law – it is that the moral law reflects his nature and since his nature is good, he would never command you to do something bad . 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Well, that is all fine and dandy, if you have the Greek conception of God. The Aristotelian God is a perfectly rational being. He exits as a pure form without any relation to matter. He is the source of change in the world, but the world does not affect him. He is a perfectly perfect being and as a result he cannot contemplate anything but himself, for every material thing is lesser. 
        </p>

            This is not the Hebrew God. The God of Christianity. This is not the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob .
        </p>
        <p>
            The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob – the Hebrew God is involved. He begins as the God of a specific people. He manifests himself in history, moving events by virtue of his will. He is even capable of bending his will for the sake of a man. 
            There are multiple examples of this happening in the Bible, but we will look at one specific example. Moses goes up to the mountain to meet with God. The Hebrews become impatient. While waiting, they create a golden image of a calf with they proceed to worship. God says to Moses
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            “ 9 “I have seen these people,” the LORD said to Moses, “and they are a stiff-necked people. 
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            10 Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation. 
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            11 But Moses sought the favor of the LORD his God. “LORD,” he said, “why should your anger burn against your people, whom you brought out of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? 
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            12 Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out, to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger; relent and do not bring disaster on your people. 
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac and Israel, to whom you swore by your own self: ‘I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and I will give your descendants all this land I promised them, and it will be their inheritance forever.’” 
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            14 Then the LORD relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened.”
        </blockquote>      
        <p>
            We cannot reconcile this with the Aristotelian God. In a strange way, it would have been easier to reconcile, had God proceeded with his plan. That would have just been a manifestation of his perfect justice. But instead, we have a God who bent his ear to a man. Who’s will was affected by a man’s words. 
            This is a god who’s will is distinct from the moral law. This is a God who is actively involved in the world and manifests his will in history. 
        </p>

            This is a God who will ask a man to sacrifice his only son in order to test his obedience. This is what God asks from Abraham.
        </p>
            <blockquote>
            “ 2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.? 
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            9 And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            10 And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            11 And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.       
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
            12 And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
            </blockquote>
                           
        <p>
        If this story was written to test Abraham’s moral integrity, passing the test would mean refusing God’s command, but the story is set up in such a way, so that passing the test means breaking the moral law. The story is setup so that the correct thing to do is follow God’s commandments over the moral law. How are we to justify this?
        </p>
        <p>
        To start, we can accept that this is irrational behavior. Given the existence of an objective moral system, it is impossible to justify Abraham’s actions as morally sound. It is not possible for Abraham to justify his actions to any other person. He does not tell his wife Sarah, or his servant Eleazar. After all, what is there to say? He cannot tell his wife that he’s taking their son – the child of promise – up a mountain to sacrifice him to the God that promised to make him into a great nation through that very child. That is a nonsensical proposition.  We cannot justify Abraham not on the grounds of reason, but perhaps we can justify him by faith.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to justify Abraham’s actions on the grounds of faith we must first give a proper account of faith. Let us begin with what we know and understand and then proceed to what we do not understand – namely faith . 
        </p>

        The human in his basest form is only an animal. He acts according to his passions, seeking to maximize his pleasures. In this stage, there is no thought of rationality or consistency. He lives a life of indolence and luxury, seeking merely to avoid boredom by whatever means necessary. There is no self in this stage, merely a bundle of events without an inner core to constitute identity or cohesion over time. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Eventually perhaps he tires of this life. He wants to discover a self. He wants to live a principled life and acquire an identity that can sustain him. So, he casts about for a set of principles. Perhaps he uses reason or accepts the ethical constrains of some religion and in this way, he enters the stage of the ethical.
        </p>
        <p> 
        The ethical man abides by right and wrong. He engages in the pursuit of some higher truth. He pulls together all the disparate conflicting parts of himself and ties them together in pursuit of a higher ethical ideal. In this way the self emerges as a relation to a higher ideal. 
        This is where Socrates stopped. For Plato, a life guided by reason was the ultimate ideal. A human being capable of following the edicts of reason had achieved something few people were capable of. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Past the ethical stage emerges the religious. It is in the religious sphere that the self relates, not to the rational but to the absolute. The absolute is something that exists beyond the bounds of human rationality. Reason is too human. It knows nothing of anything higher than itself. But when someone crosses into the religious they relate to something higher than even reason. This is the highest state of individuation. In this stage the self becomes unable to relate itself to anything other than the Absolute. It is in this stage that Abraham is unable to speak to Sarah or Eliezer.
        </p>
        <p> 
        Faith is superfluous in both the aesthetic and the ethical. It is not necessary to have faith to pursue one’s passions. Neither is it necessary to have faith to act ethically. Especially if one’s conception of God is Greek . It is simply a matter of applying one’s reason to elucidate the moral law that emerges from the nature of God. Even the existence of such a God is a matter of rationality, as Aristotle can infer the existence of such a God on rational grounds. 
        That is not to say that to live an ethical life is easy. It can be quite tragic. Consider the tragic Greek hero Agamemnon. Agamemnon was the king of Mycena who, for the sake of his people was forced to sacrifice his daughter to Athena in order to satisfy her wrath towards the people of Mycena. On first glance this seems similar to the story of Abraham, but Agamemnon was still acting in the ethical. Given the cultural context of Ancient Greece he was understood by his people to be a good King. A man, who in order to fulfill his moral duty to his people, gave up the thing that he loved the most. The tragic hero is still acting in the ethical because his actions are ethically justifiable . Abraham's actions are not. 
        </p>
        <p> 
        What Abraham did was beyond the bounds of morality in any cultural context. Abraham did not trade his son for the sake of something else. He acted purely out of obedience. In doing so Abraham moved from the ethical sphere to the Religious sphere. This movement can only happen through faith. At this point, I still have not explained what faith is, only its place in the movement from the ethical to the religious. Let us now to try to explain the movement of faith. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A man is in love with a princess, but alas, he is but a lowly commoner and she is the apple of the King’s eye. In this case, the aesthetic man, realizing the impossibility of his desire, gives it up. He says to himself, what foolishness is this? Why should I demean myself by desiring that which I cannot have? Look and see, there is a wealthy widow. She is a better match in every practical sense. And so, the aesthetic man gives up his love for the princess. He settles into the mundane and the practical. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A man is in love with a princess, but alas, he is but he is of common blood, and she is object of adoration across the kingdom. In this case, the ethical man, realizing the impossibility of his desire, gives up the object of his love, but he does not give up love itself. He reconciles himself with the pain of loss. He accepts that he will never be with the princess, but his love preserves itself. It is embedded in him, and part of his nature and the ethical man will not change his nature for the sake of external factors. This is the movement of resignation. He resigns himself to the truth that, in the natural, his desire will never be satisfied without ever giving up his love.
        </p>
        <p>
            Look and see, for there is a man who is in love with a princess. But he is poor and destitute and she is the jewel of the Kingdom. He is an ethical man and so he makes the movement of resignation. He recognizes the impossibility of his desire and gives her up. But he is also a man of faith. And the man of faith makes the movement of resignation, but he makes one more movement still.  He gives up on the satisfaction of his desire in the natural and takes it back on the virtue of the fact, that through God nothing is impossible. He does, precisely as the ethical man, and then he takes one step further. He says, “I recognize that in the natural, I can never marry the princess, but still I believe that I shall marry her, for with God all things are possible”. This paradox in which a man gives up, completely, the object of his affections, and takes it back on the strength of God’s promise is the heart of faith. Through this movement of faith, the ethical man enters the religious sphere. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us now return to Socrates and Euthyphro. Socrates was correct that there is the moral law, that must be followed. What Socrates could not grasp is the sphere beyond the moral law. The place where the individual surpasses the moral law and where obedience to the Divine can only be understood in terms of faith. Without the existence of such a sphere the Christian god is redundant. He is superfluous to the moral law, unless he is more than the moral law in some way. If he is more than the moral law, than when the moral law diverges from his commandments, obedience to the divine can not be justified by rationality (for morality is rational) . It can only be justified by faith. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this way the Euthyphro problem is solved, not on rational grounds, but as a necessary aspect of the Christian life.
